        <p class="title">Teaching Assistant</p>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ajala Horne, I am 18 years old, and I am apart of HYPE’s first international experience.
          I am a senior at Westlake High School and graduate in the Spring of 2018. YAY!
          I began my journey in coding my freshman year of high school. 
          I learned the basics and fell in love with technology ever since.
          My favorite application on my phone would have to be either Snapchat or Houseparty at the moment because they are both fun ways to interact with friends.  
          I have participated in hackathons, built web pages and applications for competitions and nonprofits, participated in Girls Who Code, and taught some coding classes ate my school. 
          Soon I will be a freshman in college pursuing a degree in computer science to later become a software engineer with a doctorate. </p>

        <p class="title">Teaching Assistant</p>
        <p> Hello My name is Corliss Stinson I’m from Atlanta, Georgia! I’m 18yrs old and I love technology. 
          I have a passion for the technology field and also science sometimes.
          My dream is to have my own business that deals with technology. 
          I would be the first in my family to graduate with a high school diploma and also go to college.
          My favorite device is a computer/laptop.  They have many different problems that could occur including when they break or just stop working simple things.
          For me that's good because I will always find a way to locate the source of the problem and fix it myself without having to take it to a professional to deal with the problem. </p>

        <h4>Janell Tanner</h4>
        <p class="title">Teaching Assistant</p>
        <p>Hi! I’m Janell Tanner, I’m 18 years old and currently a freshman at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
          I am originally from Cleveland, Ohio, but I’ve spent most of life living in Atlanta. 
My favorite piece of technology are my bluetooth headphones because firstly they’re very convenient because I don’t have to worry about them getting caught up in something or snatched out of my phone. I love them secondly, and most importantly, because I love listening to music as it helps to create so many positive vibes and can also help me to alleviate the stress of being a college student. I’m very passionate about enabling others to be successful in life and especially in STEM because STEM is a field that is constantly changing the world we live in and I feel as though we should have some sort of say in those changes.
Fun Fact: I am a fraternal twin !
Hobbies: Shopping! (and drawing)
